# One-Shot Free-View Neural Talking Head Synthesis
Unofficial pytorch implementation of paper "One-Shot Free-View Neural Talking-Head Synthesis for Video Conferencing" from [zhanglonghao](https://github.com/zhanglonghao1992/One-Shot_Free-View_Neural_Talking_Head_Synthesis).

****
### This folder contains our code for various tasks like quantizing and video conference wrapper.
1. Quantization contains modules used to quantize hopenet-model and quantizationmodel.ipynb contains my try to perform learning aware quantization on pretrained weights.
2. Implementation folder contains a wrapper used to run inference on Live-Video Feed.
3. /Implementation/One-Shot contains the implementation of model.
****
```Python 3.9.5``` and ```Pytorch 1.11.0``` are used.
