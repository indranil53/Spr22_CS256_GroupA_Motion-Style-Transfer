# One-Shot Free-View Neural Talking Head Synthesis
Unofficial pytorch implementation of paper "One-Shot Free-View Neural Talking-Head Synthesis for Video Conferencing" from [zhanglonghao](https://github.com/zhanglonghao1992/One-Shot_Free-View_Neural_Talking_Head_Synthesis)

# Quantization 
To run one can specify thru the command line: 


```
python QuantizeHopeNet.py
```
Or you can run the model from the IDE
